* Prerequisites & assumptions
- a vzlogger {{{api}}} is available at <url>:<port>
- different meter registers are available with distinct (known) identifiers
- the {{{api}}} gives a timestamp and an associated energy reading for a register id
  
* Highlevel description
- the {{{api}}} is called with a set of register identifiers called ``channels''
- the readings from this are saved to a collection of a (predefined) size
- if there are at least 2 elements in this collection, a mean power $P_{mean}$ can be calculated like
  #+begin_export latex
  \begin{align*}
    t_{diff}  &= R_1^{t} - R_0^{t} \\
    e_{diff} &= R_1^{e} - R_0^{e} \\
    P_{mean} &= \frac{e_{diff}}{t_{diff} \cdot 3.6\cdot10^{6} }
  \end{align*}
  #+end_export
  where
  - $R_n^{t}$ denotes the timestamp of register $n$ (\si{\milli\second})
  - $R_n^{e}$ denotes the energy of reading $n$ (\si{\kilo\watt\hour})
  - $t_{diff}$ is the time difference between two readings (\si{\milli\second})
  - $e_{diff}$ is the energy differnce between two readings (\si{\kilo\watt})

* Usage
After building the executable via e.g. ~dotnet build~, the options can be retreived by calling ~./RestAPICS --help~.
This will give the following output:
#+begin_src sh
  Description:
    A consumer of a vzlogger REST-API packet, that will perform some statistics 
    based on channels that are identified in the vzloggerOptions config-file.
    It will deduce a mean power from the meter readings of the specified channels 
    and compare a current power against it. Upon predefined threshold values, it will
    signal warnings to any attached listeners.

  Usage:
    RestAPICS [options]

  Options:
    --config <config>              Absolute path to the domain logic configuration json-file. It should 
                                   provide parameters for

                                       - ErrorThreshold
    --vzloggerconf <vzloggerconf>  Absolute path to the Vzlogger configuraion json-file. It should 
                                   provide prameters for
                                       - ApiUrl
                                       - A dictionary with some channel IDs (with none specified, the 
                                   whole application makes no sense)
    --log <log>                    The absolute path to the log-file that should be used.
