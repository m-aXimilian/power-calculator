* Purpose
For a power meter that is exposed via [[https://github.com/volkszaehler/vzlogger][vzlogger]], this aims to constantly calculate a (mean) power from subsequent energy readings for a collection of channels (available via a REST-interface).

* Usage

** Build
With a ~.NET~ availabel on the host, run 
#+begin_src sh
  dotnet build
#+end_src
to generate the ~PowerCalculator~ executable.


** Use
The command ~./PowerCalculator --help~ will prompt how to use the application.
Something like this is the exepted output:
#+begin_src sh
  Description:
    A consumer of a vzlogger REST-API packet, that will perform some statistics 
    based on channels that are identified in the vzloggerOptions config-file.
    It will deduce a mean power from the meter readings of the specified channels 
    and compare a current power against it. Upon predefined threshold values, it will
    signal warnings to any attached listeners.

  Usage:
    RestAPICS [options]

  Options:
    --config <config>              Absolute path to the domain logic configuration json-file. It should 
                                   provide parameters for
                                       - MovingAverageNumber
                                       - WaitbetweenApiCall
                                       - VzLoggerChannelFilter
                                       - WarnThreshold
                                       - ErrorThreshold
    --vzloggerconf <vzloggerconf>  Absolute path to the Vzlogger configuraion json-file. It should 
                                   provide prameters for
                                       - ApiUrl
                                       - A dictionary with some channel IDs (with none specified, the 
                                   whole application makes no sense)
    --log <log>                    The absolute path to the log-file that should be used.
